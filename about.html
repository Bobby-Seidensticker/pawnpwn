  <h1>Welcome to Pawn Pwn!</h1>

  <p>
  Pawn Pwn is a fun game you can play between two players - either in person, or over the Internet.
  The game is designed to work well in a web browser, an iPad or any mobile smart phone.  Depending on the
  size of the screen, you will see:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A 9 x 9 board on which you will take turns moving your pieces.</li>
    <li>A graphical representation of the history of the game.  The closer your get
      to your opponent's home row, the lower your colored line gets on the graph.  First
      one to <i>zero</i> wins!</li>
    <li>A move list.  Move notation indicates the row and column your pawn is moving to
      (just as in chess notation).  Wall placements list the square at the upper right
      of the placed wall, and whether a wall is placed <i>vertically</i> or <i>horizontally</i>.</li>
    <li>Undo/redo buttons.  You can take back the last move, or replay moves that have been
      taken back by hidding the foward or backward arrows on the board.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Rules for Pawn Pwn</h2>
  <p>
  The goal of Pawn Pwn is to get your pawn to your opponent's home row
  before he can reach yours. On your turn you can either:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Move your pawn one space forward, back, left or right.</li>
    <li>Place one of your walls on the board to make your opponent's path longer.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><i>You are not allowed to completely prevent your opponent from reaching your home row
  along <b>some</b> path.</i></p>

  <p><i>Note: when two pawns meet in the middle of the board, your pawn may jump to any square
    adjacent to your opponent's pawn (i.e., you can jump over your opponent's pawn).</i></p>
